# TSF-Internship-Tasks
# Task 1
# Prediction using Supervised ML
● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● Dataset: http://bit.ly/w-data

# Task-2 
# Prediction using Unsupervised ML 
● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

● Use R or Python or perform this task.

# Task-3
# Exploratory Data Analysis-Retail
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’.

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

● You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel).

# Task-4
# Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
● For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
